    <h1>Semantic Null Distribution</h1>
    <p>This app calculates a null distribution of semantic similarity scores (using the dot product) with a target word. If a contrast word is specified, the relative similarity scores are used.
    <br>The null distribution is based on randomly selected words which fit within a template sentence. The template sentence uses a $ symbol to represent the word to be randomized.
    The template sentence also requires a part-of-speech tag (for the pos_tag function from the NLTK toolkit) that determines the grammatical form allowed for random words.
    Examples of tags are: 'JJ' for adjectives, 'NN' for nouns, 'RB' for adverbs, 'VB' for verbs.
    <br>To pick words fully at random, use only a $ for the sentence and keep the part-of-speech tag empty.
    <br>Scores can be entered for which to calculate p-values.
    <br>If there is a problem with the input (e.g., an unrecognized word or tag), an empty distribution will be returned and any p-values will be set to 666.

    <h2>Input</h2>
    <form action = "semnull_results" method="POST">
        Target word:  <input type="text" name="target_word">
        <p>Contrast word:  <input type="text" name="contrast_word"></p>
        <p>Comma-separated similarity scores for which to get p-values:  <input type="text" name="scores_to_test"></p>
        <p>Template sentence, where $ represents the word to randomize: <input type="text" name="template_sentence"></p>
        <p>Randomized words' part-of-speech tag: <input type="text" name="template_pos"></p>
        <p><button>Submit</button></p>
    </form>
    <h2>Example</h2>
    To test the significance of the semantic similarity score between "owl" and "wise", take "owl" as the target word. Random words will then replace "wise".
    <br>The similarity between "owl" and "wise" could be taken from SemSim or SemTag. Relative similarity scores could be taken from SemSim.
    <br>The null distribution is formed by replacing the word "wise" with randomly selected of words, and storing their similarity scores with "owl".
    <br>The template sentence could be "The animal is %", with part-of-speech tag "JJ", for adjectives.
